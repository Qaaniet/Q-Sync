>The way that reading the email and making notes along side helped getting this done was insane. If I didn't do it this way then it would have taken so much longer. When I read, I wrote down all of the information e.g. serial numbers. When the forms came I didn't have to look through emails. I'm realizing that without this you only skim emails. With the note taking app I'm scanning and saving information from emails making everything down the line easier.

Call logged with me, awaiting response from Lenovo
