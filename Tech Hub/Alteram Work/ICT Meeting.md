## Meeting ICT 01.12.2025

CEO of ICT working in IT will address the challengers that SASSA faces
  - Knowledgeable about IT, has ground experience
  - Not sure on knowledge on finance
HR, HCM, support required from the CEO

### Directive to Scan
Directive to make sure that every document gets scanned, scan in bulk with the desktop scanners, using Paper-Stream.
Push files to head office.
The coversheet of the files did not send through to head office
  - Most likely the main info of date and time
Increase of bandwidth from 2mb to 5mb to assist with large files
Batching issue, files are scanned but are not finalized and sent to head office

### System is Down
BBE had an exception list whereby under certain circumstances they could switch to manual application
  - System is stable in terms of downtime at head office not the local offices
  - If interface is down 1201 you are able to do but 1204 you are not able to complete, you can capture an application but not finalize an application
  - If home affairs does not verify then it creates a problem for SASSA, Home Affairs in the process of migrating data. They are not up to date with their system. Creates challengers for SASSA. SASSA is allowed to override this if Home Affairs does not have the data to verify
  - Home Affairs does not have the biometrics of refugees, therefore SASSA has to first capture on SOCPEN and then the uploading to BBE can happen
  - When it comes to foster care quad 7s without birth certificates onboarding has a challenge
Issue regarding applications for refugees. Process if broken

A person that is migrated needs to 

Network in Bellville is slow, much of time is spent waiting

Network infostructure, 15 out of 28 are done. 

### Missing Files
60 day period to fix the batch that was scanned and uploaded
A file has 5 stages
Scanned 
Transported
Boxed
Dispatched
Missing files speaks to the last stage, so long as the E-cover sheet exists they can account for that file
When the file is received from SOCPEN, when a user states a file is missing, Liquid office, BRM is checked if there is nothing then it is regarded as a ghost file and the customer is deleted
Complete the E-Cover sheet, it produces the barcode. The means of verification cannot only be on the online system. It shows a fraction of the work that is actually done.
SASSA report stating that file is missing is correct 
Taking application on the ground, head office sees it far later, if a payment is ready for the next day they need to wait for a long time until head office can verify
Files are processed but does not reflect
Files need to be captured multiple times but the staff does not reflect this extra work

### E-Cover Sheet
Tried the E-cover, forms need to go to RMC to scan and all of that work shows up under their name.
They wait 30-40 days to get the forms to reflect 
Head Office provides the data, Local Office provides all of the information
