Unload thoughts, concepts, or raw ideas here:  Ok so mostly this is about testing my new keyboard. Got one for my birthday. Turned 24. Still need to find my writer voice on some hank moody type thing. Anyway just a quick typing until I finish Boudjie and come back to using this constantly. Need to break some bad habits, need to create some healthy ones. Took 2 days off from work. Hopefully this goes well in terms of productivity. I'm learning that Obsidian is great but not for working on design elements, as in nothing that can be structured with a set time. Perhaps it should function closer to how the rubric and weekly sessions are structured in first year university.
